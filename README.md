# SIMPLE HTTP API SERVER 

# Project background 
Not too long ago, I created a private web app for my family's construction company using Ruby on rails and React. The site is hosted on digital ocean and has been running very well.
This endevor has inspired me to explore how i can leverage the skills i picked up while creating this full stack app and develope a product that could be monetized and potentially sold. I have several ideas and am currently on the early stage of development. This repo is a open source and public project testing out Go by creating a very simple HTTP api. If you are looking for example of a simple api, i hope you find this helpful!!
# description

This API is will hold JSON objects of people in server side memory. There is a REACT.ts project within the project files to visualize the API.
